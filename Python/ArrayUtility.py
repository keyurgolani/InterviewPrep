        A team of analysts at needs to analyze the stock prices of a company over a period of several months.
        A group of consecutively chosen months is said to be maximum profitable if the price in its first or last month is the maximum for the group.
        More formally, a group of consecutive months [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) is said to be maximum profitable if either:
        stockPrice[l] = max(stockPrice[l], stockPrice[l + 1], ..., stockPrice[r])
        or, stockPrice[r] = max(stockPrice[l], stockPrice[l + 1], ..., stockPrice[r])
        Given prices over n consecutive months, find the number of maximum profitable groups which can be formed. Note that the months chosen must be consecutive, i.e., you must choose a subarray of the given array.
        Example,
        Consider there are n = 3 months of data, stockPrice = [2, 3, 2].
        All possible groups are shown in the leftmost column.
        | Possible Grouping | Stock Price of first month | Stock Price of last month | Maximum stock price in group | is Maximum Profitable? |

        | [3, 2]            | 3                          | 2                         | 3                            | Yes                    |
        | [2]               | 2                          | 2                         | 2                            | Yes                    |
        All 5 groups other than prices [2, 3, 2] are maximum profitable. In [2, 3, 2], the maximum value 3 is neither the first nor the last element.
        Return 5.

        Brute Force Solution:
        Very basic way of achieving this result would be to iterate through the array of prices finding all possible sub-arrays.
        Go through each subarray identifying if the first or last element of given subarray is the max value i.e determining if the subarray is max profitable.
        If the subarray is max profitable, increment a global counter and move on.
        At the end, return the global counter.
        Runtime: O(n^3) Space: O(1) --> This is because we will find n^2 subarrays and to find their max we will have to iterate each of them once more.

        Optimized Solution:
        One way to approach this, would be to realize that we can directly target counting the max profitable subarrays instead of going through all of them and identifying max profitable.
        To do this, we will identify that, any subarray that starts or ends at the max value in given array, will be max profitable.
        Also, any other array that contains the max value in given array, will not be max profitable because the start or end value can never be max.
        Hence, out of all the arrays that include max element in an array, we can count number of subarrays starting or ending in max element and ignore all other subarrays.
        After this, we can start breaking down this problem in pieces and hone in on the arrays that are created by searating main array into two from max element. Repeat the above process on both new parts of arrays and keep repeating.
        Finally, the base condition for recursion will be when the array has just one element where it will always be max profitable.
        On each iteration, we send back the max profitable window counts for the subarray we're operating on. At the end, we get desired result for the whole array.
        Runtime: O(log2(n)) Space: O(1) --> Here, recursive calls will occupy O(log2(n)) heap space but no additional space used by code"""

        # Recursive version of the method that will take the left and right bounds of original array and treat that window as the original array for given recursion.
        # Within this method, we will refer the subarray from left to right (right including) as the original array going forward.
        def findMaxProfitableWindowCount(left, right):
            # We will always have max profitable windows as the amount of elements in original array.
            # This is because all elements will have a window that either starts at given element and ends at max element in that array or starts at max element in that array and ends at given element.
            answer = (right - left + 1)
            # If left and right point to the same element, we will only return answer (only one element so answer will be 1) for this recursion.
            # However, if left and right form a window that contains more than one elements, we count more max profitable windows contained within subwindows.
            if right - left != 0:
                # We need to find the index of max element in given array to identify where to split the array from. Initialize it to None and max element to 0.
                maxElementIndex = None
                maxElement = 0

        """Problem:
        You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
        Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

        https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water

        Brute Force Solution:
        To find the water contained between any two building, we would need to find the distance between them and multiply with the height of shortest building.
        Any more water will spillover from the smaller building.
        Simplest way to find the maximum water contained between any two buildings would be to pick each combination of two buildings one by one and iterate through them.
        For each combination of two buildings, find the water contained by those two. Compare against a global max and if larger, update the global max.
        At the end of all iterations, return the maximum water that can be contained.
        Runtime: O(n^2) Space: O(1)

        Optimized Solution:
        To optimize the approach to this, we need to realize that water bound between a pair of buildings is limited by the height of the building that's shorter.
        However, the two maximum height buildings can be very near to eachother and contain much lesser water than what other smaller height buildings that are far apart could.
        Hence, to optimize this, we start with the max distanced buildings. Identify the shorter building and move inward from that direction.
        For each pair of buildings, find the water contained between these buildings and update a global max.
        After performing this until both the pointers meet eachother, the global max we've found should be the max water contained with any pair of buildings.
