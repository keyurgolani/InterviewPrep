    Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV.

        Numbers in roman are represented with above described logic.
        Hence, to identify roman representation for an input integer number, we can create a mapping of what integer number has a readily available roman value representing it.
        For all the other values, we will use a combination of lesser value roman representations to represent it.
        Here, since our map is of constant, limited size, we iterate over the map and identify if input integer number will use given mapped roman representation for it.
        Since the roman representation will have number representations in order of largest to smallest, we can simply start from largest value and keep appending the representations that we use to an answer.
        When we identify that one roman number representation will be used in the answer, we reduce the value of input integer number by that much and keep looking.
