        Save a counter of the elements that are inside the sliding window in a hashset.
        While adding a character to sliding window, check the character against the hashset.
        If the set contains the character, iterate over to given character's slide over the left pointer of sliding window over till repeating character is eliminated.
        Update hashset accordingly.
        While doing this, keep track of every valid sliding window's length and update the max.
