        Use two pointers to point to a starting and an ending position within the inputString that would denote a substring.
        Go through each value for pointer such that we iterate over all possible substrings of given inputString.
        While iterating over each possible substring, identify if the substring is palindromic.
        To identify if the substring is palindromic, start traversing the substring character by character, match characters from front of the substring and back.
        If all characters from front and back are the same until comparison reaches mid point of substring, we identify that the substring is palindromic.
        If the substring that we are iterating over, is palindromic, check its length. If it's larger than previously seen maximum length palindromic substring, update the saved result.

        Runtime: O(n^3) Space: O(1)
        Optimized:
        Because in previous approach, we are using start and end indices as our bases, many of the palindromic substring checking work is duplicated.
        For example, if the inputString was `abba`, we will check substring `bb` to be palindromic 4 times within each 3 or more length substring of the inputString.
        Instead, one optimization could be, iterating through each character in inputString, expanding outside from the character as center of palindromic substring.
        This way, we go as far as we can go with given character as the center of palindrome, and if it's larger length than one we've seen before, we update the max length we've seen so far.
        After doing this with each character of the inputString, we look at another possibility that the palindromic substring might be of even length.
        Here, the two center characters will be a duplicate pair.
        So we iterate through each character in the inputString again finding a pair of duplicate characters next to eachother.
        We expand from there on each side to see how long a palindromic substring with those characters at the center could be, again updating the max length we've seen so far if we find one.
        At the end after the iteration is done, return the final value of the saved max length palindromic substring we've seen so far.
