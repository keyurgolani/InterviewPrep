        While iterating over each possible substring, identify if the substring is palindromic.
        To identify if the substring is palindromic, start traversing the substring character by character, match characters from front of the substring and back.
        If all characters from front and back are the same until comparison reaches mid point of substring, we identify that the substring is palindromic.

        Instead, one optimization could be, iterating through each character in inputString, expanding outside from the character as center of palindromic substring.
        This way, we go as far as we can go with given character as the center of palindrome, and if it's larger length than one we've seen before, we update the max length we've seen so far.
        After doing this with each character of the inputString, we look at another possibility that the palindromic substring might be of even length.
        Here, the two center characters will be a duplicate pair.
        So we iterate through each character in the inputString again finding a pair of duplicate characters next to eachother.

    Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is '-' or '+'. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.

    Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. "123" -> 123, "0032" -> 32). If no digits were read, then the integer is 0. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
    If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be clamped to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be clamped to 231 - 1.
